# SpaceBalloid
''' 
Make sure you open the python file with an editor,
then run it to avoid getting this error spam:
"libpng warning iccp: known incorrect srgb profile"
I really don't know any fix for that so any help is
welcome.
Oh, and by the way, the file you want to run is 
called "spaceballoid.py"
